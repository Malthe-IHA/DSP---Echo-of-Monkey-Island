\section{Introduction}
This project will look at the audio effect \emph{echo}. As part of this subject, we will look at the impact of delay between the initial audio impulse, and the following echo(s). Apart from the echo effect, we will look at the resulting perception, when the amplitude of the echoes are modulated as well.

Expanding on the echo subject, we look at generating the effect of a \emph{chorus}, starting with a single vocal track. As part of this, we wish to generate multiple vocal tracks, with slight changes in the audio delay (From the echo project), as well as modulating the frequencies, to simulate the effect of different singers.

With this project, we hope to demonstrate the following subjects from the DSB course:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Knowledge of the Discrete Fourier Transform, in the form of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in MatLab.
	\item Demonstrate the ability to create digital filters with a specific purpose in mind (Generating an echo).
	\item Analysis of digital filters, and the effect on an audio track. This includes the step response, as well as poles and zeros of the filters.
	\item Demonstrate the ability to utilize the frequency domain to alter the contents of an audio signal (Chorus effect).
\end{itemize}
