\subsection{Analysis of the filter}

\subsubsection{Stability}
A FIR filter is inherently stable, since it has a finite response to a step input. We can investigate this further, by looking at the poles and zeros of the filter transfer function in the $Z$ domain.
since stability is describes if a given filter response ever goes below any given cutoff point. A FIR  goes to 0 after the length of the signal  plus the filter order no further investigation of the specific filters stability is warranted.
