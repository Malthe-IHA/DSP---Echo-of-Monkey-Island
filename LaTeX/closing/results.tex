\section{Results}
The first sound clip we tried to alter with the chorus effect, was the strumming of a chord on the guitar. This sound clip was specific selected because the chorus effect should be prominent on string instruments. 
In \colorbox{red}{figure...},the result of the chorus effect in the time domain is shown. Since the delay is only \SI{30}{\milli\second} it is difficult to see any effect on the visualized data. Meanwhile by listening to the signal in audio format revivals a big difference. This is to be expected thus the small delays introduced by the chorus modulation gives rise to tiny frequency changes. These tiny varying frequency changes leads to a so call beat frequency effect which are easily detected by the ear.

With such small changes in frequency a more scattered frequency spectrum ought to be expected, which is also the case as shown in \colorbox{red}{figure}. The scattering occurs when the frequency bins is not small enough to cover all the present frequencies.
