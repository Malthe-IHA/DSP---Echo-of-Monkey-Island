\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The only parameter which has been adjusted thought this project is the delay. Leading to the realization that the human ear perceive delays of varying length and strength differently. As seen in the case of the echo and chorus effects, the only parameter altered is the delay and yet the effect is very different in nature.

Meanwhile this project merely scratched the surface of possible effect which can be generated using delays, including flange, doppler, vibrato etc.     

The describe audio effects are traditional achieved by analog filtering, but in this case we achieved the same result using digital filtering. This has the advantage of easily experimentation with different effects for different music, thereby allowing a customization that wouldn't be achievable with analog filters.
