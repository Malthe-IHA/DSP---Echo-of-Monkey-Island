\section{Discussion}
The only parameter which has been adjusted thought this project is the delay. Leading to the realization that the human ear perceive delays of varying length and strength differently. 

the describe audio effects are traditional achieved by a analog filter, but in this case is achieved by means of digital filtering.
This allows for experimentation with different effects for different music, thereby allowing a customization that wouldn't be achievable with analog filters.
due to the cost of rewiring the circuit every time a setting needs to be changed.
