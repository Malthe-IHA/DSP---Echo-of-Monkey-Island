\section{Discussion}
The only parameter which has been adjusted thought this project is the delay. Leading to the realization that the human ear perceive delays of varying length and strength differently. 

this describe all your effects are achievable most traditionally by a analog filter but in this case is performed instead by digital filtering.
This allows for easier expectation with different effects and music, at thereby gives the abilities to adjust the effect to ideal for this specific case.
